  <h4>Dear Parents,</h4>
  
  There is nothing dearer to the hearts of parents than their children. The Child Education Society promotes schools which
  recognise that parents are the first educators of their children. Schools run by the society, help parents in this most
  precious task.
  <h2>"Discover Oaks School is a dedicated school to understanding and meeting the different needs of students in each phase of
  their development from childhood through adolescence to young adulthood".</h2>
  DOS fosters an atmosphere of trust, love and respect for each person as the basis for sound education. The highly
  qualified professional staff of the school works closely with parents to ensure that both home and school provide the
  best environment for the growth of the child. Our effort is focused not only on pure study but also on providing
  opportunity to each child to explore his or her own capabilities and area of interest. For this, we have provided each
  child with many activities both co-curricular and extracurricular to help the child become the best person he or she can
  be. DOS implements a philosophy of Personalized Education. Like all other schools of society, NPS fosters excellence.
  Excellence is achieved when each person is helped to continually develop his or her potential as an individual and a
  member of society.
  School years are crucial for the development of good habits and character which are the building blocks of excellence.
  The habit of study, the love of learning and the quest for truth, the responsible use of freedom, personal integrity and
  a willingness to help improve society, are especially important. These tools are essential to empower the student to
  become an excellent professional and a mature and responsible citizen. It is well known that the critical developmental
  period for these qualities is up to the age of twelve years. The earlier a child benefits from an education which
  fosters these good qualities the better the chance he or she has to reach his or her full potential and to make a
  positive contribution to society.
  
  <h3>I look forward to meeting with you.</h3>
  <h2>Yours sincerely
