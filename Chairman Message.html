    <h2>Chairman's Message</h2>

    <p>
      There is nothing dearer to the hearts of parents than their children. The
      Child Education Society promotes schools which recognise that parents are
      the first educators of their children. Schools run by the society, help
      parents in this most precious task. School years are crucial for the
      development of good habits and character which are the building blocks of
      excellence. The habit of study, the love of learning and the quest for
      truth, the responsible use of freedom, personal integrity and a
      willingness to help improve society, are especially important. These tools
      are essential to empower the student to become an excellent professional
      and a mature and responsible citizen. It is well known that the critical
      developmental period for these qualities is up to the age of twelve years.
      The earlier a child benefits from an education which fosters these good
      qualities the better the chance he or she has to reach his or her full
      potential and to make a positive contribution to society. 
      <h3>Yours sincerely</h3>
